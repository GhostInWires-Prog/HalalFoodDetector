# Halal Presentation App

Interactive slide deck for the Halal Product Intelligence System research project. Built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (recommend the latest LTS)
- npm (ships with Node)

## Setup

```bash
cd ml/reports
npm install
```

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts Vite on `http://localhost:5173` and opens the presentation automatically.

## Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The build output is generated in `dist/`. Use `npm run preview` to verify the optimized bundle locally.
